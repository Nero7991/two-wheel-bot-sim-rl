Purpose: Main HTML layout for Two-Wheel Balancing Robot RL web application

Recent Changes:
- Added four canvas elements to charts-panel for performance visualization:
  - reward-chart: Episode reward tracking
  - loss-chart: Training loss metrics
  - qvalue-chart: Q-value evolution
  - epsilon-chart: Exploration rate monitoring
- Added "Test Model" button to training controls section
- Implemented zoom control buttons in visualization section:
  - Zoom In (+): Increase viewport scale
  - Zoom Out (-): Decrease viewport scale  
  - Reset Zoom: Return to default scale
- Each chart canvas sized at 150px height with 100% width for responsive design

Key Components:
- app: Main application container with flex layout
- header: Application title and branding
- main-container: Horizontal flex container for simulation and panels
- simulation-canvas: Primary canvas for robot visualization
- controls-panel: Control interface with training parameters
- charts-panel: New panel for performance graphs and metrics
- webgpu-status: GPU availability indicator overlay

Dependencies:
- main.js: Application entry point loaded as ES module
- Canvas API for simulation rendering
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layout

Architecture Notes:
- Three-panel layout: simulation (flex), controls (300px), charts (350px)
- Responsive design prioritizes simulation viewport on smaller screens
- Dark theme with cyan accents for better visualization contrast
- Modular CSS organization with component-based styling
