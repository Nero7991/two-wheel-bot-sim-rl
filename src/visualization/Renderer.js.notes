Purpose: 2D Canvas visualization renderer for the robot simulation

Recent Changes:
- Fixed wheel rotation direction by removing negation in wheelRotation calculation
- Enhanced drawGround() with improved surface texture and visibility
- Added chevron/arrow pattern on ground surface for better movement reference
- Added wheel circumference-based grid lines for distance measurement
- Added colored rotation markers (red/blue dots) on wheels for clear motion indication
- Replaced random dot texture with structured chevron pattern pointing right
- Improved ground line prominence with brighter color and thicker stroke

Key Components:
- drawWheels(): Renders realistic wheel with visual rotation markers and physics-accurate size
- drawGround(): Enhanced surface with directional patterns and measurement grids
- drawRobot(): Fixed positioning for physically accurate wheel placement
- drawTorqueIndicators(): Shows motor torque visual feedback

Dependencies:
- physics/BalancingRobot.js: Gets wheelAngle and wheelRadius for accurate visualization
- main.js: Receives robot state and config updates for rendering

Architecture Notes:
- Enhanced visual feedback for wheel rotation with red/blue markers at different positions
- Ground surface now features chevron pattern for intuitive direction indication
- Grid lines aligned with wheel circumference help visualize rolling distance
- Fixed wheel rotation to match physics: positive velocity = clockwise, negative velocity = counter-clockwise
- All visual elements scale properly with different canvas resolutions (1280x800, 1920x1080)
- Improved surface texture makes rolling motion more intuitive and measurable
