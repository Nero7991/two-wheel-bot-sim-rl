Purpose: Real-time performance charting system for training metrics visualization

Recent Changes:
- Created new module with BaseChart and PerformanceCharts classes
- Implemented canvas-based line charts for optimal performance
- Added support for episode rewards, training loss, Q-values, and epsilon tracking
- Configured rolling window of last 100 data points for memory efficiency
- Added automatic Y-axis scaling and grid visualization

Key Components:
- BaseChart: Core charting functionality with coordinate transformation and rendering
- PerformanceCharts: Manager class for multiple chart instances with unified interface
- Auto-scaling Y-axis with padding and minimum range enforcement
- Background grid and axis rendering with labels

Dependencies:
- No external dependencies (vanilla JavaScript with Canvas API)
- Designed for integration with RL training loop and metrics collection

Architecture Notes:
- Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60 FPS chart updates
- Implements efficient data management with configurable point limits
- Supports data export/import for session persistence
- Modular design allows easy addition of new chart types
- Canvas-based rendering optimized for real-time data streams
