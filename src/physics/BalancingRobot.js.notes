Purpose: Physics simulation for two-wheel balancing robot with realistic wheel dynamics

Recent Changes:
- Updated default wheel radius from 0.08m to 0.12m for better visual proportions
- Expanded wheel radius validation range to 0.02-0.20m to support larger wheels
- Simplified wheel physics with direct coupling to prevent slip issues
- Replaced complex slip calculation with straightforward motor force transmission
- Improved wheel rotation to exactly match linear movement with no slip

Key Components:
- RobotState: Complete state representation including wheel rotation
- BalancingRobot: Main physics simulation with configurable wheel properties
- _updatePhysics(): Enhanced with proper rolling motion calculations

Dependencies:
- visualization/Renderer.js: Uses wheelAngle and wheelRadius for accurate visualization
- main.js: Configuration updates through updateConfig method

Architecture Notes:
- Simplified wheel physics with direct motor force coupling for visual clarity
- Perfect rolling motion: wheel rotation exactly matches linear movement
- Wheel angle normalized to prevent numerical overflow in long simulations
- Larger default wheel size (12cm radius) for better robot proportions
- Supports wide range of wheel sizes up to 20cm through configurable parameters
